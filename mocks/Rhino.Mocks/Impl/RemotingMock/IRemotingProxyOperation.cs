    /// It is not possible to directly communicate to a real proxy via transparent proxy.

    /// The only methods that are guaranteed to exist on any transparent proxy are methods defined
    /// in Object: namely ToString(), GetHashCode(), and Equals()).
    /// 
    /// These three methods are the only way to tell the real proxy to do something.
    /// Equals() is the most suitable of all, since it accepts an arbitrary object parameter.
    /// The RemotingProxy code is built so that if it is compared to an IRemotingProxyOperation,
    /// transparentProxy.Equals(operation) will call operation.Process(realProxy).
    /// This way we can retrieve a real proxy from transparent proxy and perform
    /// arbitrary operation on it.
