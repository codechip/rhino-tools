Building in visual studio
==================

The AssemblyInfo.cs is missing from the repository. The reason for that is that the build is generating updated AssemblyInfo.cs files for all projects,
with the correct version and revision notes.

You need to run:
 > msbuild buildall.build 
 
from the command line before you can build in visual studio.


Building From NHibernate and Castle Trunks
==================
1) Get the trunk sources for NHibernate, Castle, and Rhino-Tools

2) Build each project first using the respective scripts and build methods

3) Create a file in the root directory of Rhino-Tools named
   BuildFromTrunk-Config.build -- Use the sample as an example
   
   * Important *
   *
   * Castle requires NUnit on the path so be sure set Castle-Test-Framework and Castle-Tester-Console
   * in the BuildFromTrunk-Config.build file.

4) Patch Castle source to work with NH-Trunk, check out the branch that works with nh trunk!

5) Copy the new NHibernate assemblies to the SharedLibs folder of the Castle project.

6) From a command prompt with administrative access run the following command from the Rhino-Toosl root.
   >msbuild BuildFromTrunk.build /t:Build-All


Customizing A Trunk Build
==================

1) Ensure you successfully build everything from trunk given the steps above.

2) Create a file in the root directory of Rhino-Tools named
   MyBuild.build -- Use the sample as an example

3) Create a target for each one of your projects that is using NH, Castle, and Rhino
   
   The target should call the CopyTo target of the BuildFromTrunk.build script.
   Make sure you set the Dest-Dir parameter when calling the target.  By default
   libraries will be copied to $(Dest-Dir)\lib\$(Configuration) and Tools will
   be copied to $(Dest-Dir)\tools\Tool-Name.  To override these locations you
   can pass in $(Dest-Lib-Dir) and $(Dest-Tool-Dir) values.

   <Target Name=ProjectY">
     <MSBuild Project="BuildFromTrunk" Targets="CopyTo" Parameters="Configuration=release;Dest-Dir=C:\ProjectX" />
   </Target>

4) Customize what you want to copy.
   Now the fun part, you can pass parameters for the libraries you want to copy.
   Dependencies will be automatically resolved for you.  So if you want to
   use Rhino.Commons, NH, Windosr, and Castle Logging with Log4Net you could use the
   following command.

   <Target Name=ProjectY">
     <MSBuild Project="BuildFromTrunk" Targets="CopyTo" Parameters="Configuration=release;Dest-Dir=C:\ProjectX
      ;With-Rhino-Commons-NH=true
      ;With-Log4Net=true" />
   </Target>

   If you wanted a quickstart AR and Monorail application you could use

   <Target Name=ProjectY">
     <MSBuild Project="BuildFromTrunk" Targets="CopyTo" Parameters="Configuration=release;Dest-Dir=C:\ProjectX
      ;With-MR-AR-Scaffolding=true
      ;With-MR-NVelocity=true
      ;With-Rhino-Commons=true" />
   </Target>

** Tips **
  nant is case sensitive and msbuild is not so when specifying a COnfiguration parameter value use lowercase b/c nh and castle do.
  
  Patching the trunk is a pain, check the castle tree for a branch that works with NH trunk.
  
  Using Configuration=debug will give you full debug builds of all the libraries, useful for troubleshooting
     framework bugs but a royal pia for debugging your own applications.
  
  You can configure your own projects to use either the debug or release builds depending on your project config
     Unload the project, edit the references, change the path from ../lib/release/whatever.dll to ../lib/$(Configuration)/whatever.dll
